## What is serverless?

Serverless is a cloud computing application development and execution model that enables developers to build and run application code without provisioning or managing servers or backend infrastructure.

Serverless lets developers put all their focus into writing the best front-end application code and business logic they can. All developers need to do is write their application code and deploy it to containers managed by a cloud service provider. The cloud provider handles the rest, provisioning the cloud infrastructure required to run the code and scaling the infrastructure up and down on demand as needed. The cloud provider is also responsible for all routine infrastructure management and maintenance such as operating system updates and patches, security management, capacity planning, system monitoring and more.




## 1. Key Characteristics of Serverless Computing:
- Event-driven: Serverless computing is based on the concept of executing functions in response to events or triggers. These events can be HTTP requests, database updates, file uploads, or timers.
- Scalability: Serverless architectures automatically scale the execution of functions based on the incoming workload. It dynamically provisions resources as needed, allowing for efficient resource utilization.
- Pay-per-use pricing: With serverless computing, you only pay for the actual execution time and resources consumed by your functions. There are no upfront costs or charges for idle resources.
- No server management: Serverless platforms abstract away the infrastructure management, including server provisioning, scaling, and maintenance. Developers can focus solely on writing and deploying code.
- Stateless: Each function execution is independent and stateless, meaning they don't maintain persistent server-side state between invocations. Any required state or data must be stored externally (e.g., databases, object storage).

Difference from traditional server-based architectures:
Traditional server-based architectures require developers to provision and manage servers to host their applications. They need to handle capacity planning, scaling, and infrastructure maintenance. In contrast, serverless computing removes the need for server management, as the underlying infrastructure is abstracted away. Serverless functions are event-driven and scale automatically, allowing for more efficient resource utilization and cost optimization.




## 2. Getting Started with Vercel and Deploying a Serverless Function:
To get started with Vercel and deploy a serverless function, follow these steps:

Step 1: Sign up and create a Vercel account at https://vercel.com/.

Step 2: Install the Vercel CLI (Command Line Interface) by running the following command in your terminal:
```
npm install -g vercel
```

Step 3: Build your serverless function. Write your function code in a file, for example, `api/myfunction.js`, using the necessary framework or language (e.g., Node.js).

Step 4: Initialize your project by running the following command in your terminal, and follow the prompts:
```
vercel init
```

Step 5: Deploy your serverless function by running the following command in your terminal:
```
vercel
```
Vercel will package and deploy your function to their serverless platform.

Step 6: Once the deployment is complete, you will receive a URL for your deployed serverless function.




## 3. APIs and their utilization in Python applications:
APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) define a set of rules and protocols that allow different software applications to communicate and interact with each other. APIs provide a standardized way for applications to access and manipulate data or services provided by external sources.

In Python applications, APIs can be utilized to access and manipulate data from external sources by making HTTP requests to the API endpoints. The response from the API is typically in a structured format like JSON, which can be parsed and used within the Python application.

Python provides several libraries, such as Requests, to interact with APIs and handle HTTP requests and responses easily.




## 4. The Requests library in Python and an example of a basic GET request:
The Requests library is a popular HTTP library in Python that simplifies sending HTTP requests and handling responses. It provides an easy-to-use interface for making HTTP calls, handling cookies, headers, and other related functionalities.

To use the Requests library, you first need to install it. You can install it via pip by running the following command in your terminal:
```
pip install requests
```

Here's an example of a basic GET request using the Requests library:

```python
import requests

response = requests.get('https://api.example.com/data')  # Make a GET request to the specified URL

if response.status_code == 200:  # Check if the
