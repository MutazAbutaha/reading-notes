# Reading Docker :

## Key components of a Docker container: Docker containers consist of an application, its dependencies, runtime, system libraries, and a file system that are all bundled together. They streamline development and deployment by providing a consistent and isolated environment, ensuring portability, scalability, and efficient resource utilization.

## Building a library website using Django: The primary steps involve:

Models: Define the data structure for the library, like books and users, using Django models.
Views: Create views that handle user requests and interact with the models to retrieve or update data.
Templates: Design HTML templates to present data to users with the help of Django's template engine.

## Differences between Django and Django REST framework:

Django: It's a web framework for building complete web applications with user interfaces (UI). It follows the Model-View-Template (MVT) pattern and is suitable for traditional web applications.
Django REST framework: It's an extension of Django that facilitates building web APIs. It follows Representational State Transfer (REST) principles and is designed specifically for serving data to various clients in formats like JSON, XML, etc.
