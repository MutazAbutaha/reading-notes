### What are the key components and purpose of Django Rest Framework (DRF) permissions, and how do they help in securing an API?

Django Rest Framework (DRF) permissions are key components that control access to API resources. They help secure the API by defining who can perform specific actions (e.g., read, write) on certain endpoints based on user roles or authentication status.

### In SQL, what is the purpose of the SELECT statement, and how would you use it to retrieve all columns from a table called ‘employees’?

The SELECT statement in SQL is used to retrieve data from a database. To retrieve all columns from the 'employees' table, you would use the query: "SELECT * FROM employees;". This fetches all rows and columns from the 'employees' table.

### Can you explain the role of DRF Generic Views and provide examples of their usage in building a RESTful API?

DRF Generic Views simplify API development by providing pre-built views for common tasks like listing objects, creating, updating, or deleting them. For example, ListCreateAPIView combines list and create functionality, while RetrieveUpdateDestroyAPIView handles retrieving, updating, and deleting a specific object. These views reduce boilerplate code in building a RESTful API.
