## Carol Dweck on the Growth Mindset
- The idea of yet is powerful in learning enviroment as it allows the mind to embrace the idea that just because they aren't good at something, it doesn't mean they won't always be bad at it.
- A growth mindset engages the mind more deeply and they learn from errors and get better faster.
- Give praise wisely, praise the process, rather than success.
- It gives more confidence to believe in the idea of yet than to not believe in it.
- With this mindset the meaning of effort and difficulty are changed to being signs of progress and proof of them becoming smarter.

## Alain de Botton on Redefining Success
- A different way to look at success is to redefine what success is.
One way is to examine our own ideas of what success looks like and ensure it is what we actually believe and want rather then what we are told and view as success.
- Society has spent a long period of time defining success as one thing and to pursue a meritocratic society where people who use their talent, energy and skill to rise to whatever level of society they can achieve with it and that those who are at the bottom of society belong and will remain there. This idea, while good in theory, doesn't account for the unaccountable and creates a mindset that if one fails and fall further down in society, they deserve their place and cannot rise back up as they lack one of the three requirements.
- Growth Mindset is likely a way to change this idea to a better one of if you struggle or fall, it simply shows what you can learn so that you can continue to rise and achieve whatever you wish until you find and accomplish your idea of success.
